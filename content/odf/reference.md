# Manifests
## `Manifest`
An object that wraps the metadata resources providing versioning and type identification. All root-level resources are wrapped with a manifest when serialized to disk.

| Property | Type | Required | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `kind` | `string` | ✔️ | [`multicodec`](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) | Type of the resource. |
| `version` | `integer` | ✔️ |  | Major version number of the resource contained in this manifest. It provides the mechanism for introducing compatibility breaking changes. |
| `content` | `string` | ✔️ | [`flatbuffers`](https://flatbuffers.dev/) | Resource data. |

| `primaryKey` | `array(string)` | ✔️ |  | Names of the columns that uniquely identify the record throughout its lifetime |

## `MergeStrategy::Snapshot`
Snapshot merge strategy.

This strategy can be used for data state snapshots that are taken periodically and contain only the latest state of the observed entity or system. Over time such snapshots can have new rows added, and old rows either removed or modified.

This strategy transforms snapshot data into an append-only event stream where data already added is immutable. It does so by performing Change Data Capture - essentially diffing the current state of data against the reconstructed previous state and recording differences as retractions or corrections. The Operation Type "op" column will contain:
  - append (`+A`) when a row appears for the first time
  - retraction (`-D`) when row disappears
  - correction (`-C`, `+C`) when row data has changed, with `-C` event carrying the old value of the row and `+C` carrying the new value.

To correctly associate rows between old and new snapshots this strategy relies on user-specified primary key columns.

To identify whether a row has changed this strategy will compare all other columns one by one. If the data contains a column that is guaranteed to change whenever any of the data columns changes (for example a last modification timestamp, an incremental version, or a data hash), then it can be specified in `compareColumns` property to speed up the detection of modified rows.

| Property | Type | Required | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `primaryKey` | `array(string)` | ✔️ |  | Names of the columns that uniquely identify the record throughout its lifetime. |
| `compareColumns` | `array(string)` |  |  | Names of the columns to compared to determine if a row has changed between two snapshots. |
