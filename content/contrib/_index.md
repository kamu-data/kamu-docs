Thanks for considering contributing! This project is a massive undertaking and developed just by a few people, so every little bit helps.

We welcome contributors of any skill level and background. You [don't have to be a software engineer](https://dev.to/navendu/how-to-make-non-code-contributions-to-open-source-projects-35nj) to make a large impact in an open-source project! 

Besides code you can contribute in many different ways: 

- Improving the [documentation](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-docs)
- Graphic design
- Adding more interesting [data science examples]({{<relref "examples">}})
- Improving CI pipelines
- Working with the [community](https://discord.gg/aSpVjWwu)
- Mentoring others
- and much more...
