Please see [Exploring Data section]({{<ref "explore">}}/#jupyter-notebooks) for how to run an integrated Jupyter Notebooks environment with `kamu`.

Soon we will be releasing the `kamu` Jupyter extension as a stand-alone library to let you fetch data from any ODF-compliant server.

If yor use case requires this - [let us know](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli/issues)!
