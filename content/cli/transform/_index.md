## Conceptual Model
Open Data Fabric clearly separates two types of data:
- **Source** - represented by {{<term "root datasets" "root-dataset">}} this data comes directly from external systems, with party that owns the dataset having complete authority over the data and fully accountable for its veracity
- **Derivative** - represented by {{<term "derivative datasets" "derivative-dataset">}} this data is produced by transforming and combining other datasets (root or derivative).

In simple terms, given two root datasets `A` and `B` the derivative dataset `C` can be though of as a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function):

```
C = f(A, B)
```

Unlike databases, or most data processing libraries you might've used ODF is not "batch", but **stream-oriented**. So `A`, `B` here are both potentially infinite [data streams]({{<relref "spec#nature-of-data">}}), and function `f()` is a [streaming (temporal) processing]({{<relref "spec#stream-processing-model">}}) operation that produces another stream as an output.

Stream processing composition works just like normal functional composition:

```
D = h(C) = h(f(A, B))
F = g(D, E) = g(h(f(A, B)), E)
```

This allows us to build **infinitely complex data processing pipelines** and supply chains in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):

{{ <image filename="/images/cli/examples/reth-vs-snp500/pipeline.png" alt="Web3 data pipeline"> }}

Functions being "pure" means that {{<term "derivative datasets" "derivative-dataset">}} don't depend on any information outside of ODF - you cannot call arbitrary APIs or download files as part of such processing. 

While this may seem restrictive - this unlocks highly desirable properties like {{<term "reproducibility and verifiability" "verifiability">}} of all computations and ability to automatically derive {{<term "provenance">}}.

Imagine being able to erase all derivative data in the world and [reconstruct it in identical form]({{<relref "spec#derivative-data-transience">}}) just from source data. Derivative data in ODF sometimes feels like a superpower.

## Creating Derivative Datasets
Derivative datasets are created by specifying the {{<schema "SetTransform">}} metadata event.

Example:

```yaml
kind: DatasetSnapshot
version: 1
content:
  name: my.trading.holdings
  kind: Derivative
  metadata:
    - kind: SetTransform
      # Using one dataset as an input
      inputs:
        - datasetRef: my.trading.transactions
      transform:
        # Using Apache Flink SQL engine to perform cumulative sum streaming aggregation
        kind: Sql
        engine: flink
        query: |
          SELECT
            event_time,
            symbol,
            quantity,
            price,
            settlement,
            sum(quantity) over(partition by symbol order by event_time rows unbounded preceding) as cum_quantity,
            sum(settlement) over(partition by symbol order by event_time rows unbounded preceding) as cum_balance
          FROM `my.trading.transactions`
```

This event is as simple as defining two things:
- `inputs` - data from which datasets will be used as input to this pipeline step
- `transform` - the transformation being performed.

Technically ODF supports [any data processing framework]({{<relref "spec#engine">}}). You will see a lot of Streaming SQL in our examples as we believe it currently offers best user experience when defining streaming transformations.

## Execution Model
When you use [`kamu pull`]({{<relref "cli-reference#kamu-pull">}}) on a derivative dataset the tool will:
1. Start the appropriate {{<term "query engine" "engine">}}
2. Restore the state of computation from previous {{<term "checkpoint">}} (if any)
3. Feed the **previously unseen** data from all inputs
4. Write results into a new {{<term "data slice">}}
5. Suspend the computation state into a new {{<term "checkpoint">}}
6. Write a new {{<term "metadata block" "metadata-chain">}}

Note that query engines **see input data only once**. When performing things like windowed aggregations the intermediate state of computations between the suspends is stored in {{<term "checkpoints" "checkpoint">}}.

## Supported Operations
Some typical operations you can perform on datasets (in the order of increasing complexity) are:
- **Map** - performing computation on one record at a time
- **Filter** - deciding whether to include a record in the output based on some condition that considers only one record at a time
- **Aggregation** - combining values of multiple records together based on some grouping function (e.g. a time window)
- **Projection** - an aggregation aimed at reducing dimensionality of data
- **Stream-to-Stream Join** - combining several streams of data based on some predicate and a time window
- **Temporal Table Join** - joining a stream to a projection of another stream that represents "current state" of some evolving data based on the timestamp of individual records.

Please see [Examples]({{<relref "examples">}}) for detailed explanation of each of these classes of operations.

## Consistency
Modern stream processing frameworks should be more appropriately called *"temporal processing frameworks"* as they account for time of records and all kinds of time-related problems during the computations.

Transparently to the user streaming can handle situations like:
- Late arrivals and backfills
- Out-of-order arrivals
- Phase shift and differences in data arrival cadences when joining several streams

Unlike batch that has no notion of time, streaming is a **more complete processing model** that provides you complete **control over the tradeoff between consistency and latency**.

Stream processing to batch is like what calculus is to algebra!

## Self-correcting Nature
While we mostly talk about data streams from perspective of observing new events and adding new records - there are many situations when events that were already published may be deemed incorrect and need to be **retracted or corrected**.

We [previously discussed]({{<relref "merge-strategies#snapshot">}}) retractions and corrections in the context of {{<term "merge strategies" "merge-strategy">}}, but the most amazing thing about stream processing is that it **can automatically react to retractions and corrections in inputs** to issue appropriate retractions or corrections in the output.

This means that whenever a major issue is detected and fixed in some {{<term "root dataset">}} - these events can **automatically and rapidly propagate** through hundreds of data pipeline stages with no human involvement.

{{<tip>}}
Imagine you publish a research paper based on some medical dataset. Few months passes and the hospital that published the dataset notices and corrects a major inconsistency in data. By linking your paper to a certain range within the source dataset you will be able to get an instant **notification** that your results may be no longer valid. And if your analysis is also stored as an ODF dataset - it can be **instantly updated** accounting for all corrections.
