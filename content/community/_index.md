We welcome participation from everyone - join, ask questions, and get involved!

## Discord
Stop by and say "Hi" in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nU6TXRQNXC) - we're always happy to chat about data, and value your feedback.

## YouTube
Subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWciDIWI_HsJ6Md_DdyJPIQ) to get fresh tech talks and deep dives.

## GitHub
We do most project tracking on GitHub, and vast majority of communication occurs there.

The top-level repositories are:
- [open-data-fabric/open-data-fabric](https://github.com/open-data-fabric/open-data-fabric/)
- [kamu-data/kamu-cli](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli)
- [kamu-data/kamu-node](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-node)
- [kamu-data/kamu-web-ui](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-web-ui)

## Roadmap
[Open Data Fabric](https://github.com/orgs/open-data-fabric/projects/2/views/1) has its own roadmap.

We are preparing to make the existing multi-year Kamu roadmap public, but most of it can already be seen as "Epics" in top-level repositories ([example in kamu-cli](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aepic)).
