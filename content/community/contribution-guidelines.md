Thanks for considering to contribute! This project is a massive undertaking and developed just by a few people, so every little bit helps.

We welcome contributors of any skill level and background. You [don't have to be a software engineer](https://dev.to/navendu/how-to-make-non-code-contributions-to-open-source-projects-35nj) to make a large impact in an open community project! 

Besides code you can contribute in many different ways:

- Improving the [documentation](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-docs)
- Graphic design
- Adding more interesting [data science examples]()
- Improving CI pipelines
- Working with the [community](https://discord.gg/aSpVjWwu)
- Mentoring others
- and much more...

Before you start working on anything:
1. Consider joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aSpVjWwu) to discuss your ideas
2. Make sure your work has an associated **GitHub issue**, it's assigned to you, and the scope of work was agreed upon with project maintainers (we value your time and really don't like rejecting PRs!)
3. Technical contributors should read the [DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md) for instructions on correctly setting up their environment (similar files exist in all top-level repositories)
4. Understand the [Licensing Terms]()
