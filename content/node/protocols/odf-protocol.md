Kamu Node implements both Simple and Smart Transfer Protocols according to the [ODF Specification]({{<relref "spec">}}).

Simple Transfer Protocol can be used for read-only access data via HTTP in constrained environments.

Smart Transfer Protocol can be used to very efficiently push and pull datasets with metadata compression and using direct downloads/uploads from the underlying object storage where possible.
