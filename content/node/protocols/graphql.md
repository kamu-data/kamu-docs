[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is our primary API for interacting with the node when building rich applications. [Kamu Web Platform]({{<relref "platform">}}) uses it extensively.

Here you can access [interactive GraphQL playground](https://api.demo.kamu.dev/graphql) of our demo node.

The playground is also available when you run your local node or when you use `kamu system api-server` CLI command under the HTTP port.

Here you can find the latest version of static [GraphQL API schema](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli/blob/master/resources/schema.gql).
