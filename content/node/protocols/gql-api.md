Please use `/graphql` endpoint of the **`api-server`** node component to find the current GraphQL schema.

This endpoint also serves the GraphQL Playground which you can use to query server interactively.

Latest schema can also be found in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli/blob/master/resources/schema.gql).
