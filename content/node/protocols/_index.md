Kamu Node supports multiple network protocols for managing metadata, bulk uploads/downloads of datasets, and querying data.

Not sure where to start? Here are some suggestions:
- [REST]({{<relref "rest">}}) is best for interacting with the node from scripts, libraries, and system-to-system integration
- [GraphQL]({{<relref "graphql">}}) is best for interacting with the node when building rich applications
- [FlightSQL]({{<relref "flight-sql">}}) is the most modern way to connect SQL-based systems together including various BI and analytics tools
- [MQTT]({{<relref "mqtt">}}) is used to ingest real-time data from IoT devices
- [OData]({{<relref "odata">}}) can be used to integrate with some legacy systems
- [Blockchain Oracle]({{<relref "oracle">}}) can be used to query data directly from nodes into smart contracts
