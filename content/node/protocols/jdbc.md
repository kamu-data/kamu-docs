Kamu Node supports JDBC protocol through FlightSQL adapter.

To use it you will need a special client-side driver JAR.

Please see instruction for connecting [DBeaver]({{<ref "/cli/integrations/dbeaver">}}) and [Tableau]({{<ref "cli/integrations/tableau">}}) to Kamu for guidance on where to download the drive and how to configure the connection.
